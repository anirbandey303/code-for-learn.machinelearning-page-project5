#Python Introduction

Python is an object oriented programming language which is widelyly used and is very popular. It was created by Guido van Rossum in 1991 and developed by Python Software Foundation. Python can be used to do a variety of tasks like:
*Create Web Applications(Server side)
*File Handling along with database systems
*Machine Learning

Python works on various platforms like Linux, Windows, Mac, Raspberry Pi, etc and has very simple syntax similar to English. These simple syntax can actually reduce the lines of code compared to other programming languages.
Another remarkable feature of Python is it runs on interpreter system, meaning that code can be executed as soon as it is written. This means that prototyping can be very quick.

The latest version of Python is Python3 and we’ll use this for the entire course.
We can use any text editor to write python code. Also we can use Python in an Integrated Development Environment, such as Thonny, Pycharm, Netbeans or Eclipse which are particularly useful when managing larger collections of Python files.


































####Variable input and Output

The syntax for taking input and output is very simple!
For taking an input in a viable:
‘’’
a = int(input(“Enter number”))
‘’’
For output:
‘’’
‘’’
print(a)‘’’

##Conditions and If statements
Python supports the logical conditions from mathematics:
Equals: a == b
Not Equals: a!=b
Less than: a<b
Less than or equal to: a<=b
Greater than: a>b
Greater than or equal to: a>=b
These conditional statemets are used with if statements:
####If
The if statement is written with ‘if’
‘’’
a=10
b=20
if a>b
	print(“a is greater than b.”
‘’’
####elif
The else if statement is written as ‘elif’
‘’’
a = 10
b = 10
if b > a:
	print("b is greater than a")
elif a == b:
	print("a and b are equal")
‘’’
####else
The else state is written with ‘else’
‘’’
a = 200
b = 33
if b > a:
	print("b is greater than a")
elif a == b:
	print("a and b are equal")
else:
	print("a is greater than b")
‘’’
